calibration procedure

apply known voltage
use multimeter to measure voltage

adjust pot on LM358 to desired current
use multimeter in separate reading to measure current

* beware of voltage drop on current measurement
* beware of programmer cable affecting calibration

record voltage and vadc
record current and iadc
this is V2

short out voltage to get zero reading
record voltage and vadc
record current and iadc
this is V1


recent calibrations:

for blue screen unit
2 sept 2011
3.09V 208mA
603   34
V2    = 1.67
adcV2 = 316
I2    = 0.200
adcI2 = 37

for red screen unit
2 sept 2011
V2    = 3.07V
adcV2 = 629
I2    = 0.200
adcI2 = 42

current seems to be only measurement affected by ftdi

current resolution should be 5mA
voltage resolution should be 5mA
